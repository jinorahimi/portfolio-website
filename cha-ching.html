          <h2>Context</h2>
          <p>Cha-Ching is a personal project that was completed as part of my UX Immersion program at CareerFoundry.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Cha-Ching is a native mobile peer-to-peer payments application, developed for individuals that don’t want the hassle of using multiple credit or debit cards. This application aims to be a simple, secure, and intuitive transactional tool
            for payments and transfers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>The amount of online transactions has been steadily increasing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. People are staying inside, and do not use cash or their physical cards as often. I developed Cha-Ching as a response to this growing
            need for contact-free payments. With this project, my goal is to find a solution for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>How can we make payments and split bills quickly and efficiently?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>How can our banking and card details be stored in one app?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>How can we track our payments and do our budgeting all in one place?</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User Research Methods</h2>
        <p>For the Generative or exploratory research phase, I conducted user interviews and card sorting to understand user’s goals and paint points at the beginning of the project. This research informed the direction of my design.</p>
        <p>For the Evaluative research part of the project, I conducted Usability and Preference testing to give me the insight I need to design a functional, efficient, usable, and intuitive user experience.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>The Double Diamond Strategy</h3>
        <p>I used the Double Diamond strategy to give structure to my problem-solution cycle. At the beginning of the project, there were many directions the project could go and I needed a strategy to narrow it down and stay focused. The iterative
          process of Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver provided a framework for understanding my problem and designing a solution for it.</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
        <p>To better understand users frustrations and needs, I started my research by analyzing two existing peer-to-peer mobile applications Venmo and Zelle. By conducting a competitor analysis, I identified weaknesses in my competitor’s user
          experience and looked for opportunities for creating solutions to problems users encounter with these products. I particularly focused on points of frustration and features that could be improved. Additionally, I looked for design patterns
          that make my competitors successful.</p>

        <h2>Opportunities for Cha–Ching</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Design a simple and minimal user interface. Financial transactions are already complicated. Keeping the interface simple and minimal helps users complete their task easily and quickly without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Provide a feature to send and request money to multiple people in one transaction and to split bills with friends and family. Venmo and Zelle only allow payments to one person at a time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Develop a feature that lets users categorize payments in order to do their budgeting in the same application.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>I conducted four user interviews to make sure I am solving a real problem for real people and design a successful, intuitive user experience. My research goals were to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Better understand user behavior around digital payment solutions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Identify user frustrations and pain points with exiting payments applications on the market.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Determine what tasks and features users need in a payments applications.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Better understand the context in which users would use a payments applications.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>User Research Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
        <p>After collecting qualitative data from user interviews, I used affinity mapping as a tool to sort my data into manageable clusters and identify relationships between users thoughts, emotions, and comments. I analyzed my clusters of data
          to expose user insights and turn them into tangible concepts for my user personas.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Insights from User Interviews</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Users are hesitant about using new digital payments applications, mostly because they are worried about the security of their financial information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users are using more than one app to manage their finances. By providing all the options they need in one application, I can reduce the number of financial apps they use.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users would like to be able to track their expenses, see their past transactions, and categorize their expenses.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>User are more likely to complete digital transactions if they can save their credit card information. They don’t like to put their information in every time they make a purchase or transfer money.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users do not seek help when they encounter an issue completing digital transactions on existing applications. They usually ask someone they trust to help them or try to use another credit card. If the issue is not resolved yet, they
              will give up and not complete the transaction.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users would like to make sure they are sending money to the right person. They need an option to verify the email address or phone number before transferring the funds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Users would like to receive bonuses or rewards for their frequent use of an application’s services such as earning cash back on their purchases at participating businesses.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Younger users are more likely to use third party applications for making small transactions on a daily basis. A feature that allows users to manually split payments between multiple people is helpful for them.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>I created user flows to discover what screens of my app are needed before beginning the information architecture phase of the project. Then, by walking through my user flows from my personas points of view, I ensured that I design a
          screen for each of my personas core needs.</p>

        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
        <p>I used card sorting to understand how I should organize and map the information of my application. After conducting card sorting, I analyzed the results and documented the patterns I discovered to form my app’s structure. Card sorting
          also helped me in labeling my categories for navigation. Below, you can see my most recent sitemap after a few iterations of testing.</p>

        <h2>Evaluative Research Method</h2>
        <h3>Moderated Remote Usability Test</h3>
        <p>After designing the first iteration of my high-fidelity wireframes, I conducted a usability study to help me improve my design. The moderated remote usability test was conducted with 6 participants from my target audience. Participants
          took the test in their own environment. I was present to guide participants and answer their questions and concerns. The sessions were recorded and participants shared their screen as they completed the tasks. My goal with this study was
          to evaluate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>How participants attempt to complete tasks using the product</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How long it takes participants to complete tasks</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whether participants enjoy interacting with the product</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whether the product has any critical errors</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Where participants get confused</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Whether there are additional features that participants need</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <h3>Challenges & Learnings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>All the sessions took longer that I had planned. This was because I hadn’t originally considered that participants had a lot of feedback to share and they needed more time to complete each task. I planned each session to take 20
              minutes, but in reality each session took 40 minutes.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>There was a technical issue with a few of the participants. Zoom screen sharing stopped working a few times during the session. I had to ask participants to stop completing the task and restart sharing their screen. This was
              frustrating and distracting for my participants.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I forgot to enable participant screen sharing on Zoom before my first session. The session was delayed for a few minutes as I had to enable screen sharing during the study. This was inconvenient for my first participant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When participants were not sure what a button does, they shared their thoughts in the form of a question. It wasn’t easy for me to stop myself from responding and over-guiding my participants. But I managed to respond with a question
              instead, for example: What do you expect to happen when you click that button?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Usability Test Results</h2>
        <h3>Affinity Diagrams and Rainbow Spreadsheets</h3>
        <p>I used Affinity Diagram and the Rainbow Spreadsheet as tools to organize information from my usability tests, classify my observations, and present my results in visual patterns. When categorizing errors, I paid attention to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>How many errors did users make? What was the frequency of the errors?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How severe were the errors?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How easily could users recover from the errors?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I revised my prototype to address the errors, based on evidence from my rainbow spreadsheet.</p>

        <p>The Usability testing helped me identify a few major issues on the home page. Participants did not find the QR code feature on the tab bar useful. Five participants said they have never used the QR code feature. They did not find the
          “Comment” and “Like” options useful either. Instead, they wanted to have the option to categorize and filter transactions so that they can do their budgeting. Participants needed the option to filter their payments and choose to only see
          their payments to others, or others’ payments to them.</p>
        <p>In the second iteration of the design, I removed the QR code feature from the menu and replaced it with an essential feature: Spending Reports. Users can still scan QR codes for a faster payment on “Pay” and “Request” pages.</p>
        <p>I also removed “Comment” and “Like” features from recent transactions. Instead, I provided an actions icon that allows users to modify the transaction details. I added an option to filter transactions in order to view all transactions,
          deposits, withdrawals, or recurring payments only.</p>
      </div>

        </div>
        <p>When I conducted my first round of Usability Testing, participants could not easily find their monthly statement. They were looking for statements on the same screen as their spending report. Additionally, participants expressed their
          need for a second chart in order to understand how they’re doing compared to previous months.</p>
        <p>In my second iteration, I consolidate monthly statement and spending report, so that users can access them on the same screen. I also added a second chart that visualizes user’s spending over a year.</p>
        <p>After conducting peer review, I learned about the accessibility issues of the “Reports” screen. In my third iteration, I made the tappable categories larger, so that it’s easier to read and select a particular category. I used a bigger
          font size and changed the spending amount color to red so that users can quickly view their total spending. I also changed the shades of green for my spending chart to create more contrast between different categories, so that user can
          recognize the spending categories from each other.</p>

        <p>After conducting the first iteration of Usability Testing, I found out that it took participants a few moments to find “Add Contact” button on user’s profile page. They felt it is ergonomically difficult to reach the button. It was
          located at the top right corner of the screen. They also expressed a desire for more clarity by providing two separate buttons for making payments and requesting money.</p>
        <p>In my second iteration, I fixed these errors by moving the “Add Contact” button from top corner towards the center of the screen for better accessibility, and I also provided two different buttons “Pay” and “Request” for more clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>Cha–Ching Design Language</h2>
        <p>In the end, I organized my deliverables to make sure they can easily be understood. I prepared a summary of my research, high-fidelity wireframes, mockups, all of the assets, my style guide, as well as my pattern library. I also included a
          document with notes, instructions, and guidelines relevant to the project. Creating a pattern library and style guide makes it easier for me to reuse what I’ve developed and add new sections of my app in the future.</p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>I come from an arts background where my own subjective viewpoint drives the works I create. This was my first project in UX Design, and the biggest challenge for me was to forefront my target audience’s needs and desires before my own
            point of view. This is how I learned the value of user research and the significance of user feedback at different stages of the design process. I believe research is the key to deep user understanding and success of a product.
            Qualitative
            and Quantitative research methodologies allow me to discover my own assumptions and biases about what users need, and design a product that helps users achieve their goals and desires.</p>

          <h2>Plans</h2>
          <p>My goal is to improve the user experience of my application by designing additional features that my target audience needs. Financial transactions are complicated. I would like to focus on features that help users trust the application
            and
            feel confident that their information is safe and secure. Additionally, I aim to reduce points of frustration from my product in order to make it more efficient and enjoyable. I can achieve this through gathering and analyzing feedback
            from
            research participants that are outside of my personal network.</p>
